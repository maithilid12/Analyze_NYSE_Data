# Introduction
In this project:
- I have analyzed real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. 
- Iâ€™ll be drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. 
- I have created a smaller subset of the data that I will be using for the project using the Fundamentals.csv and Securities.csv files provided by Kaggle.
- Summary statistics and insights is performed for 3 banks
- P&L statement and Financial forecast can be performed for all the companies

# Project Overview
- Developed a dynamic Profit and Loss Dashboard that calculates the Gross Profit, Total Operating Expenses and Operating Profit or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list
- Created a dynamic Financial Forecasting Model including forecasts for Revenue, Gross Profit and Operating Profit for two more years using scenario analysis to forecast future growth prospects for the company
-  Calculated summary statistics including measures of center and spread for the financial business metrics in the Financial GICS sector for Banks GICS sub-category
-  Drew inference from the statistical to create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways

# Questions addressed:
1. What portion of revenue is able to cover operating expenses generated by the banks?
2. Which bank generates more Total revenue each year?
3. Do the 3 banks have similar spread in their Total Revenue and Total Operating Expenses?
